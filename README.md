# MAUI Nonsense App

This is a fun experimental app where I explore the possibilities of .NET MAUI.

The purpose of this project is mainly to try out features and learn what MAUI can do in practice.  
Itâ€™s not intended to be a polished production-ready application (yet ðŸ˜‰).

## ðŸ”· Planned Features

âœ… Pedometer / step counter  
âœ… QR code scanner  
âœ… User registration & login, with email confirmation  
âœ… Role-based authorisation and access control  
âœ… Possibly a backend (likely in .NET, but subject to change)

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- Frontend: [.NET MAUI](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/maui/)
  - Targets: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS
- Backend: To be determined (most likely ASP.NET Core Web API)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) or newer
- Visual Studio 2022/2025 with MAUI workload installed
- Android/iOS emulators if you want to test on mobile

### Building & Running
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pudelosha/MAUI-Nonsense-App.git
cd MAUI-Nonsense-App
```

Build and run the app:
```bash
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

Or open the solution (`.sln`) in Visual Studio and run from there.
